This week’s challenge was the culmination of the first 4 weeks of material and the Flatiron way. Initially when prompted with the requirements of the project, I was exceedingly optimistic that I held a full understanding of the necessary tools to complete the task.

After jumping in, I soon found out that my confidence was misplaced and the project was more difficult than expected. That was humbling, but oddly rewarding.

I had consulted various blogs about starting projects from seasoned developers and one common theme was to create a project that meets the desired goals but built on a skeleton that can be fleshed out at a later date, whether with new features or a simple refactor to make the program more efficient. That seemed like valuable advice and I immediately set out, with pen and paper, to create the program that I envisioned and, to borrow a phrase from Avi, write the program that I *wanted* with an outline that could be filled in later with more elaborate details.

I went through various iterations of projects with designs on scraping different sites and using that data in a functional way. Finally, I settled on scraping the best new albums as reviewed by Pitchfork and using a simple CLI program to interface with the data and provide the user with the ability to quickly navigate between the options.

The overall setup was easy enough on paper, but when venturing into IDE for the actual code, I soon learned that just the initial setup for the structure of the program and providing the correct requirements for the environment necessitated more attention than I had imagined. Of course, this is something that is new to me - and all of us in the same cohort - so that newness was bit of a hill to overcome. After overcoming the novelty of the setup and proceeding from scratch on numerous occasions, it became easier to visualize. It’s something that I won’t underestimate going forward with new projects.

Additionally, IDE itself posed some issues, including random disconnects which caused loss of progress. Thankfully, Chris has stressed push changes to Github frequently so progress lost was generally only a few lines at a time. Still, this caused the project to be extended considerably as I had to continually engage in the delete and clone dance within IDE. 

This reinforced the necessity of a proper local environment setup and that will be a priority in setting up this week. On that note, Flatiron provides a great walkthrough for that setup. This is for MacOS users:

As for my initial approach, I had felt comfortable in using pen to put to paper the elemental code and placeholder data. The idea was to then put that into working code and once functional, slide the dynamic data from the scraping method into an object that could be used to replace that static placeholder data. After reviewing numerous walkthroughs, I was confident in that approach. As most things go, however, the project didn’t proceed as smoothly as designed. 

Of course as stressed by Avi, Chris, and Flatiron, a developer functions in an environment of broken code that they then need to fix. This first project was a perfect example of that philosophy, at least for me. I’m thankful that I learned those lessons and will heed them for the future as the foundation has been laid to build upon over the weeks and months ahead. 

My project finalized, I’m happy that it’s done and proud that I was able to work through it, even though I am fully aware that it could be much better. Different ideas for extended functionality and refactoring to streamline the code are obvious possibilities that would be priorities in a work environment. As this project is submitted, I look forward to the review at the end of this week and this week’s new assignments. 

Still, I’m not sure I’ll be able to resist the allure of forking my project and improving upon it in my own time. I know that extensive refactoring is in my immediate future!

If there is one thing I would suggest as advice for anyone reading this in the future: take advantage of all of the support - from fellow students in your cohort to the cohort lead - while working. You’re not in this alone and it’s good to be reminded that the support system is there for you to succeed. Above all though, have fun learning!
