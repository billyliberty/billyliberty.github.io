Like many others before me, I took the jump and started a journey to a new life by committing to the Flatiron bootcamp. Like everyone before me on this journey, a unique set of circumstances brought me to this moment.

I had been contemplating this for a couple of years, since I first read through a Twitter thread about personal experiences concerning bootcamps, but had been hesitant due to the relatively sizable investment of both time and capital. As a perfect storm of circumstances surrounded me, two old friends provided me with the encouragement and means to move forward with this life-change and I jumped in to this world of immersive coding. Without their push, I may still be standing on the side of the shore. 

I have hopes that this blog will be a catalog of that journey and my personal growth as I proceed through the program. 

If anyone comes across this in the future, I hope that I give them hope that the decision that they’re about to make is the correct one. Even though I’m not finished, I know I made the correct choice. This just feels like the way that this life was meant to be. I'm having fun learning and am happy. What else could be better?

I’ll admit that I am moderately anxious about this journey. It’s the end of week 3 and we’re now on to our first project - the CLI Project - and subsequent review on our progress. It’s a bit daunting in totality, but broken up into bits, it’s more easily digestible. Still, the technical review at the end of next week is a looming cloud I'm trying to not let condense into a storm that darkens my optimism. 

I’ll be updating this blog this week with details on my project and with specifics on some of the technical hurdles I had to overcome or particular approaches I researched and utilized while developing that project.

Future updates will be more regular as I focus on specific technical issues and solutions. Even after just a couple of weeks,  I know I’ve found many blogs from previous students more than helpful in explaining methods or structures of Ruby that I was having difficulty grasping. I’d love to add to that knowledgebase in my own small way as this community seems both welcoming and a positive force for personal development. 

Now onto the project!
